Title: The King's Avatar Fan Page

Description: The application is a fan site that allows users to  learn more about the novel and its adaptations as well as the best moments in the novel to allow readers
to reread their favorites moment without having to search desperately for hours.
The project was built using a full REST API using springboot on IntelliJ and then connected to REACT JS to display on the front-end. I also used the 'toast' and
'stackable panes' libraries available on github.
To run the project, you must first run the JPA project, after which you can post all initial data using postman and, finally, run the project in visual studio.
One of my biggest challenges was getting the stackable panes to work, as I had a lot of difficulty in trying to get each pane displaying a corresponding fan
favorite scene. I did end up finding a fix after a lot of trial and error and debugging. However, when a user adds a scene or deletes one, the page doesn't refresh, so
I hope to be able to change that in the future. I would also like to add arcs/favorites depending on the adaptation in the future.
